    "paragraph3": "I have a solid background in JavaScript and TypeScript, with deep experience in React and its ecosystem, especially Next.js. I've worked with various styling libraries and integrated numerous third-party services, including payment gateways, Google APIs, charts, authentication systems, CMSs, and also with React Native for mobile development.",
    "paragraph4": "I'm a problem solver by nature. I love when things work, but I thrive even more when challenges ariseâ€”they're opportunities to learn and grow. What do I bring to your team? I'm like a Swiss Army knife: from building UIs from scratch to solving niche bugs or animating components, I adapt and deliver solutions.",
    "paragraph5": "Beyond software engineering, I'm also a math teacher. While studying to become a professor, I discovered my love for problem-solvingâ€”which led me into programming. I enjoy teaching, sharing knowledge, and playing chess (not professionally, but often). Iâ€™m also into video gamesâ€”especially strategy, FPS, and sports games.",
    "paragraph6": "I stay active by playing football (soccer) and hitting the gym a few times a week.",
    "paragraph7": "I'm deeply passionate about astronomy. I love watching documentaries and reading about space. One of my personal goals is to become an astrophotographer and share the beauty of the universe through my lens."
